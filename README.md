# Theerthaprasad Gowda

## Senior Software Engineer | Distributed Systems | Reliability Engineering

I design and build large-scale distributed systems with a strong focus on scalability, fault tolerance, and performance optimization. My work centers on high-throughput backend platforms, observability-driven development, and production-grade reliability.

## Core Expertise

### System Design & Architecture
- Microservices & Modular Monolith design
- Event-Driven Architecture
- Distributed Systems & CAP trade-offs
- High-throughput API design (10k+ RPS)
- Caching strategies (Redis, multi-layer caching)
- Horizontal scaling & load balancing
- SLO/SLA-driven system design

### Backend Engineering
- Go | Rust | Java
- Concurrency & memory optimization
- REST & gRPC services
- Database schema design & query tuning
- Streaming systems & message queues
- Infrastructure as Code

### Reliability & Performance
- Load testing with k6
- Chaos engineering & failure simulation
- Integration & contract testing
- CI/CD automation
- Observability-first systems (metrics, logs, tracing)
- Zero-downtime deployment strategies

---

## Engineering Philosophy

- Design for failure before scale.
- Optimize for clarity over cleverness.
- Measure latency, throughput, and error budgets.
- Automate everything that can break.
- Build systems that degrade gracefully under load.
