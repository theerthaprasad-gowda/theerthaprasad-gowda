# Theerthaprasad Gowda

## Senior SDET | Automation Architect | Quality Engineering Leader

Senior Quality Engineer with 5+ years of experience building scalable automation frameworks and owning end-to-end quality strategy for high-volume telecom and billing systems. 

I specialize in transforming manual-heavy testing environments into CI-driven, automation-first ecosystems that improve release velocity, stability, and production confidence.

Focused on building quality as an engineering discipline — not a support function.

## What I Bring to Product Teams

- Design automation frameworks that scale with the product
- Integrate quality gates into CI/CD pipelines
- Reduce regression cycles through stable, maintainable test architecture
- Build internal tools that eliminate manual operational overhead
- Drive end-to-end ownership across UI, API, and backend layers
- Improve release confidence with measurable quality metrics

# Automation Architecture & Strategy

### Framework Engineering
- Designed and scaled 300+ regression automation suite for ordering platforms
- Built modular Selenium + Serenity + Cucumber frameworks
- Introduced Playwright for faster and more stable UI automation
- Designed reusable utilities for data setup and environment handling

### API & Backend Automation
- Automated 100+ API endpoints using JMeter and Postman
- Validated billing, rating, and usage workflows in Kenan system
- Built shell-driven backend execution tools reducing manual ops from 30 minutes to single-click

### Internal Tooling & Productivity Engineering
- Developed **Autobot-FX** (JavaFX + Playwright) to generate test data 5× faster
- Built web-based automation for executing 60+ backend billing jobs
- Created data extraction tool (Matrix) for non-prod test configuration readiness

---

# CI/CD & Quality Engineering

- Integrated automation into CI pipelines (Bitbucket, Bamboo, Jenkins)
- Enabled weekly release cycles with stable automation support
- Designed regression strategy for channel ordering systems
- Implemented test reporting & failure triaging workflows
- Improved defect detection earlier in lifecycle via API-first testing

---

# Domain Expertise

- Telecom & Billing Systems
- Kenan (Billing, Rating, Usage)
- Channel Ordering Applications (Self-Help & Agent Assist)
- Integration testing (file-based & synchronous interfaces)
- End-to-end system validation across UI → API → Backend

---

# Leadership & Ownership

- Owned complete test strategy for ordering applications
- Led regression planning and release validation
- Coordinated across dev, product, and business teams
- Designed quality standards for billing demand implementations
- Mentored peers on automation best practices and framework design

---

# Engineering Mindset

- Automation is infrastructure, not scripts
- Stability over speed, but design for both
- Shift-left testing and API-first validation
- Measure release confidence, not just coverage
- Build tools that reduce long-term operational cost
