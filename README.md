## Key Projects

### ECOM Test Suite
Designed and scaled a Selenium-based regression automation suite (~300+ tests) integrated with Jenkins CI to support telecom ordering applications.

### Autobot-FX
Built a JavaFX + Playwright desktop application to generate test data through UI workflows, eliminating backend dependency in non-production environments.

### AJP (Automated Job Processor)
Developed a web-based tool to execute 60+ Kenan backend jobs (billing, rating, usage), reducing manual effort and execution time significantly.

### Matrix
Created a web application to extract and structure test/configuration data from non-production environments, improving test preparation efficiency.

## Engineering Approach

- Treat automation as a product, not a script.
- Focus on stability before scale.
- Integrate quality into CI/CD, not post-development.
- Reduce manual dependency through intelligent tooling.
- Design reusable and maintainable frameworks.
